# Overview

This Angular project is part of my learning journey in web development. I have followed [Traversy Media's Angular Crash Course](https://youtu.be/3dHNOWTI7H8?si=2zc3LYpWdpI3xd-z) to complete this project. However, while following the instructor, I had to make some adjustments to the code due to me using a *newer* version of Angular (i.e., v18) and the instructor using version 14.

**The purpose of this project is to learn Angular framework.**
