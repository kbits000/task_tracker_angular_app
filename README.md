# Overview

This Angular project is part of my learning journey in web development. I have followed [Traversy Media's Angular Crash Course](https://youtu.be/3dHNOWTI7H8?si=2zc3LYpWdpI3xd-z) to complete this project. However, while following the instructor, I had to make some adjustments to the code due to me using a *newer* version of Angular (i.e., v18) and the instructor using version 14.

**The purpose of this project is to learn Angular framework.**

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
